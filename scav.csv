He moves like a bird made of car parts, lightly, bobbing his head. And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity is based on movement like a T. rex made of car parts, and he’ll lose you if you don’t move. But no, not Velociraptor. You stare at him, and he just stares right back. And that’s when the attack comes. Not from the front but from the side, from the other raptor made of car parts you didn’t even know was there. Because Velociraptor’s a pack hunter, you see, he uses coordinated attack patterns and he is out in force today. And he slashes at you with this — a six-inch retractable car part, like a razor, on the middle toe. He doesn’t bother to bite your jugular like a lion, say...no, no. He slashes at you here...or here...or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines. The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you. So, you know, try to show a little respect.",8 points
